Hey, I work on some stuff in my spare time, and I wanted to share some more of it with the community. 

I figured if I was gonna do that, I might as well be a little extra, and learn to use a templating language, in this case pug, and generate some sort of blog. 

For now though, I think I'll stick to nearly default layouts and focus on the content!
